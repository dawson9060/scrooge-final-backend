We serve the app with php artisan serve from the root directory (./backend)
That runs it on localhost:8000 by default

when cloning this repo for a new project, run 'composer install' as the first command via command line to get vendor files installed and artisan commands working

run a migration with php artisan migrate

Table / Model naming convention:
    By default, Laravel assumes:
        - The model name is singular and PascalCase (e.g., Post)
        - The table name is plural and snake_case (e.g., posts)

mysql depends on laragon running -> go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin then to pawswap db to access db
